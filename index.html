              whether the sensation calms down.

              Juan Ponce de León is often associated with the legend of the “Fountain of Youth,” the idea that drinking
              from it could restore youth. This story is commonly shared as a myth and inspiration for the human desire
              to stay young.

              There is a species nicknamed the “immortal jellyfish” (often cited as <em>Turritopsis dohrnii</em>) that’s
              known for a biological process where it can revert to an earlier life stage under certain conditions.
              Scientists study it for insights into aging and regeneration.
